<!-- Privacy Policy for BTCSE Wallet Last updated: 03/04/2025 -->

This Privacy Policy explains how BTCSE Wallet ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, shares, and protects your information when you use the BTCSE wallet app (the "App"). The App serves as a frontend interface providing access to services from btcse.org, including blockchain wallet functions and cloud mining. Please note that BTCSE Wallet, the developer of the App, is a distinct entity from btcse.org.

1. Information We Collect
   We collect minimal information to enable the App’s functionality, as outlined below:

- Wallet Information:
  The App generates and stores a seed phrase securely in the encrypted storage of your device. This seed phrase is used solely for wallet functions, such as sending transactions and querying your BTCSE wallet balance. It is never sent, shared, or transmitted outside your device.

- Cloud Mining Information:
  For cloud mining services provided by btcse.org, the App collects:
  Transaction IDs: Identifiers for transactions processed through btcse.org.
  Reward Wallet Address: The wallet address you designate to receive mining rewards.

- Device and Usage Data:
  We may collect limited technical data, such as your IP address, device type, operating system version, and usage statistics (e.g., features accessed or error logs), to ensure the App operates correctly and to improve its performance.

- No KYC or Personal Data:
  The App does not require Know Your Customer (KYC) verification and does not collect personal information such as your name, email address, or identification documents.

2. How We Use Your Information
   We use the collected information for the following purposes:

- Wallet Functions:
  To generate your wallet address, facilitate transaction sending, and query your BTCSE balance using the locally stored seed phrase.

- Cloud Mining Services:
  To enable btcse.org to process transaction IDs and deliver mining rewards to your specified wallet address.

- App Improvement:
  To analyze usage data and device information to enhance the App’s functionality, security, and user experience.

3. Sharing of Your Information
   We share certain data with third parties to provide the App’s services:

- btcse.org:
  As the provider of blockchain services, transaction tracking, and cloud mining, btcse.org receives:
  - Receiver wallet addresses (for transactions and rewards).
  - Transaction IDs (for processing and tracking).
    This sharing occurs via API integration to enable the App’s core features.

- Payment Processors:
  For cloud mining purchases, various payment processors (including btcse.org and others) handle payment transactions. These processors receive necessary payment details directly from you, and we do not store or process this data.

- Legal Obligations:
  We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or that of our users or others.
  Note: We do not sell your information to any third parties.

4. Data Security
   We implement the following security measures to protect your information:

- Seed Phrase Security:
  Your seed phrase is stored locally in your device’s encrypted storage. We do not have access to it, and it is never transmitted outside your device.

- Blockchain Security:
  The App leverages the inherent security of the BTCSE blockchain for transaction integrity and reliability.

- Data Transmission:
  Any data shared with btcse.org (e.g., transaction IDs, wallet addresses) is transmitted securely via encrypted API calls.
  While we take these precautions, no system is entirely secure. You are responsible for protecting your device and seed phrase.

5. Your Rights
   Since the App does not collect personal identifying information:

- Traditional data rights (e.g., access, correction, or deletion of personal data) do not typically apply.
- However, as a non-custodial wallet, you have full control over your seed phrase and wallet data.


Actions You Can Take:
- Manage Your Wallet: You control your seed phrase and private keys directly on your device.
- Delete Data: Uninstalling the App removes all locally stored data, including your seed phrase. Important: Back up your seed phrase before uninstalling, as it cannot be recovered once deleted.

6. Data Retention
   We retain data as follows:

- Transaction Data:
  Transaction IDs and related information are retained for 5 years to comply with legal and operational requirements.

- Device and Usage Data:
  This is kept only as long as necessary for App functionality and improvement, typically for a short duration unless needed for security purposes.

- Seed Phrase:
  Stored locally on your device and deleted upon uninstallation of the App.

7. International Data Transfers
   The App is available worldwide, and data such as transaction IDs and wallet addresses may be transferred to btcse.org’s servers, which could be located in various jurisdictions. We ensure these transfers comply with applicable laws. If certain countries pose legal or operational challenges, we reserve the right to restrict App access in those regions.

8. Changes to This Policy
   We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Significant changes will be communicated via in-app notification. Your continued use of the App after such updates signifies your acceptance of the revised policy.

10. Additional Information

  The BTCSE wallet app is non-custodial, meaning you alone control your seed phrase and private keys. We do not store or access them. Protect your seed phrase carefully, as losing it means losing access to your wallet.

- Third-Party Policies:
  Services from btcse.org and payment processors are governed by their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing them for full transparency.

- Age Restriction:
  The App is intended for users 18 years or older. We do not knowingly collect data from individuals under this age.

- Global Availability:
  The App is accessible worldwide, though we may limit availability in specific countries if required by local regulations.
